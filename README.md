### 👋 Hi there

I am Rohit Mehta, a computer scientist. I love to build things, automate boring & repetitive things, and I am constantly learning and challenging my technical skills. I can overcome any challenge with patience and perseverance.

Other than programming, I love anime, music and all things creative and artistic.

### 💪 Skills

I don’t like to limit myself to a specific technology or language. But for those of you who like to see a list, here is a rundown in no particular order:

- **Technical**: React, TypeScript/JavaScript, Node, Express, Python, Django, Flask, Git/GitHub, SQL, Firebase, Linux, Shell (PowerShell, Bash, Zsh), Docker, REST APIs etc.
- **Tools**: VS Code, NeoVim, Obsidian, Figma, GIMP, Audacity, etc.
- **Languages**: हिन्दी/Hindi (Native), English (Bilingual), 日本語/Japanese (Conversational) (Yes, I watch anime and read manga in Japanese!)

📚 At the moment, I am learning discrete mathematics, algorithms, and data structures through The Algorithm Design Manual by Steven S. Skiena, MIT's Mathematics for Computer Science, and leetcode for practice.
