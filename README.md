### 👋 Hi there

Hi, I'm Rohit! I'm a final year BSc (Hons) Electronics student with a fervor for computers and technology ever since high school.
I have self-studied Computer Science through programs such as the [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) and [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com/),
driven by my constant curiosity to experiment with and explore technology.

What I love most about this field is the unique combination of creativity and real-world problem-solving, which keeps me engaged
and motivated. I also have an active technical blog at [devavatar.com](https://devavatar.com/), where I share insights into my 
learning experiences and occasionally post tutorials. In my free time, I create games which I upload to [🎮 itch.io](https://avatar-hiro.itch.io/)
for everyone to enjoy.
