## 👋 Hi there

I am currently a full-time BSc (Hons) Electronics student who is currently self
studying Computer Science <a href="https://github.com/ossu/computer-science">@ossu</a>.
And I am also learning Web Development through [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com)
on the side.

🌱 I love to learn new things and
I am always looking for new ways to improve my skills.

I speak: हिन्दी (native), English (fluent), 日本語 (N4-learning).

Sometimes I make games and upload it to
<a href="https://avatar-hiro.itch.io">🎮 <u>itch.io</u></a>
for everyone to play.
